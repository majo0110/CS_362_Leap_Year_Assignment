# CS_362_Leap_Year_Assignment
Two programs that take in user input (as a number) and calculate to see if it is a leap year.
If it is a leap year, then it will display a message that user input is a leap year.
If not a leap year, then it will display a message that user input is not a leap year.

One program has error handling for user input while the other does not.
