# CS_362_Leap_Year_Assignment
Two programs that take in user input (as a number) and performs a calculation to see if it is a leap year.

Calculation:
  If user input is a factor of 4 or 400 then it is a leap year
  If user input is a factor of 100 then it is not a leap year
  else it is a not a leap year.
  
If it is a leap year, then it will display a message that user input is a leap year.
If not a leap year, then it will display a message that user input is not a leap year.

One program has error handling for user input while the other does not.
